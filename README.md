Currently I am embarking on a challenge to go through all of the stacks possible for programming. Everyday i spend my sparetime when i'm not doing anything else on designing software and working on project ideas as well as solving different algorithms. I am always active and am constantly looking to sharpen my coding skills with any tech field
that is available. Add me on my discord if you need any help with any open source projects (This could be a game project to security things as well as software development like apps or other backend oriented projects. I am also up for doing code alongs with anyone who wishes to have a "coding buddy" for immersion purposes as well as doing various
challenges.
